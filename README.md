## TetrisPuzzle

### Background and Overview
TetrisPuzzle is a fun and relaxing puzzle game inspired by our legendary, childhood game - Tetris. This is ideal for all ages!

On the main page, users can start the game or watch a quick & easy demo on how to play the game.

When the game starts, the player starts off with a 10x10 board and four random puzzle pieces. These pieces are placed strategically on the board so that the player can fit the next random four pieces that comes in. Note that the pieces <strong>can't</strong> be rotated. This process is repeated until there are no more moves available (game over).

To score points, the player automatically gets 1 point per square filled (a 3-size piece = 3pts, a 4-size piece = 4pts). In addition to this, when the player fills a whole row or column (1x10 or 10x1 ), that row/column is cleared and the player earns 10 points.
